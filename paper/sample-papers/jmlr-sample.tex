\begin{abstract}
The property of Conformal prediction to guarantee the required accuracy rate makes this framework attractive in various practical applications. However, this property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of conformal classification, for example, the systems can output multiple class labels instead of one. It is also known from the literature that the choice of nonconformity function has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers. Recently it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. In the case of Neural Network being used as a baseline classifier, the non-conformity function based on hinge loss allows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, while the non-conformity function based on margin results in a larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further extend this study. We perform our evaluation using 8 different classification algorithms and discuss when the observed relationship holds or not. Additionally, we analyze the characteristics of hinge loss and margin and give suggestions on how to combine the properties of these two non-conformity functions.
